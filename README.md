# HackAndSlash
A hackable hack 'n' slash for coders

This is a Toy I started developing on a Friday during the HR-SSP5.

The concept is to make this a game that can only be played with the developer tools, but lends itself to beginner programmers.

The more advanced users can browse the available functions and hack the script down to their own liking.

Hence, the Hack and Slash (badun-tsss)

Enjoy!
